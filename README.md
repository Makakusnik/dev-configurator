Configurator for clients

I will start working on this project around 1.- 16. October (hopefuly).

Scope:
- Single page
- Will work as multi-step form for clients with contact form on the end
- Complex animations with Framer motion
- Custom made SVG icons, pictures
- Some kind of Paralax animation (probably)
- If enough time, I will adapt it to mobile view.
